We have currently been working on adapting the 16 - obj + texture example to create an enviroment for the shooter. For now we have implemented the following:
-Removed the current models, except for the light
-mapped movement to wasd for better fps gameplay
-added walls made of cylinders to give the impression of a shooting range
-added moving targets made out of spheres that move around 
-a spolight with a short cutoff angle to simulate a laser for better aiming for the player
-the flashlight is turned on and off with the f key and camera mode is still activated by the c key
